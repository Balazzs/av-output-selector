# av-output-selector

A small tool to select a proper AudioVisual setup, correct displays (with correct layout possibly) + proper Default audio playback device for various scenarios (e.g. watching movie on TV vs 2 monir programming + youtube on TV, etc.).

My problem is that i have 2 monitors and a TV for displays and a speaker, a monitor speaker, a TV speaker, and a headset for audio outputs.
Unfortunately Windows isn't always on the top when I'm selecting various device combinations.
Extended and PC Screen Only mode are good for 2 monitor (monitor + TV) setups, but not really what I need for my problem, I usually want 2 monitors on and the TV off, except when I'm watching TV, then I want the TV on with sound. But sometimes I want the TV on with speaker sounds.

I can define various scenarios, e.g. Movie mode, when I definitely know what I want, but I have to set display settings, select default audio devices and so on, what I want is a single click solution that is always available on my system tray.
This project is meant to be that.
